# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi there, I'm Diego Diaz, a software developer from Chile.<br>üî≠ I'm currently working on building web applications using ReactJS and NodeJS. I'm also exploring web scrapping with python.<br>üå± I'm currently learning more about automated testing to enhance the quality of my code. I also enjoy reading about new technologies and trends in software development.<br>üí¨ Ask me about my experience with React, NodeJS, or SQL. I'm always happy to share my knowledge and exchange ideas with others.<br>‚ö° Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me solving some rubik's cubes, exploring new hiking trails, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
